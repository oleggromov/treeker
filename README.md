# Treeker - a fake JSX generator ðŸ¤–

Have you ever wanted to generate a _fake_ yet looking like real JSX tree for some testing purposes?

I faced the issue when I decided to work on a server-side renderer that works with React and understood that I need some fake components with either deep nesting or large number of children. Quick look-up on the internet yielded nothing so I decided to create a simple tool on my own.

## usage

First you will need to install it with either `yarn global add treeker` or `npm install -g treeker`. Now you can use it it like this:

`treeker --depth=3 --children=2 --root=App --node=Pane,Stuff,Container --leaf=Button,Paragraph`

```(jsx)
<App>
  <Pane>
    Pet partly clothing similar
    <Container>
      Build rough pipe enough
      <Paragraph>
        Dry ago
      </Paragraph>
    </Container>
  </Pane>
  <Container>
    Plant whenever young foot
    <Stuff>
      Twenty length whale mirror happened
      <Paragraph>
        Family here curve community public
      </Paragraph>
      <Button>
        Garden station
      </Button>
    </Stuff>
    <Container>
      Many process everybody gasoline result
      <Paragraph>
        Gave
      </Paragraph>
      <Button>
        Longer motion quietly boat sentence
      </Button>
    </Container>
  </Container>
</App>
```

Treeker will generate a fake JSX tree (string, actually) for you with:

- a root component you set with `--root` parameter
- nesting depth that is what you specified exactly with `--depth`
- one of a "node" components set with `--node`
- and leaf components set with `--leaf`
- where each of nodes has a number of children from 1 to `--children`
